\subsection*{Lagrange's Theorem}

\begin{thm} \label{6.1}
  Let $f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0$ be a polynomial of degree $n > 0$ with integer coefficients and assume $a_n \neq 0$. Then an integer $r$ is a root of $f(x)$ if and only if htere exists a polynomial $g(x)$ of degree $n-1$ with integer coefficients such that $f(x) = (x-r)g(x)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  To see that the existence of $g(x)$ such that $f(x) = (x-r) g(x)$ implies $r$ is a root is easy: notice $f(r) = (r-r) g(r) = 0 \cdot g(r) = 0$.

  The other direction requires some polynomial long division, which I won't Tex out because that would be a.) hell for me and b.) uninformative for the reader. Instead I will assert without evidence that $f(x) / (x-r)$ simplifies out to $a_n x^{n-1} + (a_n r + a_{n-1})x^{n-2} + \cdots + (a_n r^{n-1} + a_{n-1} r^{n-2} + \cdots + a_0) + a_n r^n + a_{n-1}r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0$, with the part from $a_n r^n$ on being the remainder. Notice, then, that since $f(r) = 0$, the remainder is $0$. Looking at the coefficients on the rest of the terms, we notice they're all made up of integers added and multiplied together, and thus must all be integers. Thus, $f(x) / (x-r)$ is a satisfactory $g(x)$ such that $f(x) = (x-r) g(x)$.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.2}
  Let $f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0$ be a polynomial of degree $n > 0$ with integer coefficients and $a_n \neq 0$. Let $p$ be a prime number and $r$ an integer. Then, if $f(r) \equiv 0 \gmod p$, there exists a polynomial $g(x)$ of degree $n-1$ such that

  $$(x-r)g(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + b_0$$

  where $a_0 \equiv b_0 \gmod p$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  We divide $f(x) / (x-r)$ as above, but instead of noticing the remainder is $0$ we notice the remainder is congruent to $0$ modulo $p$. If we let the quotient (without the remainder) be $g(x)$, then we notice $f(x) = (x-r) g(x) + R$, where $R$ is the remainder. Rearranging, we obtain $(x-r) g(x) = f(x) - R = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 - R$.

  From here, we combine $a_0 - R$ into one term $b_0$, noticing that since $p | R$ we know $a_0 \equiv b_0 \gmod p$, and obtain $(x-r) g(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_1 x + b_0$, and we're done.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.3}
  If $p$ is a prime and $f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_0$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients and $a_n \neq 0 \gmod p$, then $f(x) \equiv 0 \gmod p$ has at most $n$ non-congruent solutions modulo $p$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  We will induct on $n$. Our base case is $n = 0$, in which we are trying to find solutions to $a_0 \equiv 0 \gmod p$ where $a_0 \not \equiv 0 \gmod p$. Obviously there are $0$ solutions to this.

  Our induction hypothesis is that for $m < n$, any polynomial $g(x) = a_m x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + \cdots + a_0$ has at most $m$ non-congruent modulo $p$ solutions to the equation $g(x) \equiv 0 \gmod p$. Our induction step hopes to show this property holds for $n$.

  Say $f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots a_0$. If the equation $f(x) \equiv 0 \gmod p$ has no solutions, we're done, so we'll go ahead and assume it has one solution $x = r$. Then by \ref{6.2} we find $f(x) \equiv (x-r) g(x)$ for some $g(x)$ of order less than $n$.

  Notice that any solution $k$ to $f(x) \equiv 0 \gmod p$ finds $f(k) \equiv (k-r) \cdot g(k) \equiv 0 \gmod p$. In other words, $p | (k-r)g(k)$. By \ref{2.27}, either $p | (k-r)$ (i.e. $k \equiv r \gmod p$) or $p | g(k)$ (i.e. $g(k) \equiv 0 \gmod p$).
  Thus, \emph{any solution to $f(x) \equiv 0 \gmod p$ that is incongruent to $r$ modulo $p$ must also be a solution to $g(x) \equiv 0 \gmod p$}. By our induction hypothesis, we know there are strictly less than $n$ pairwise incongruent modulo $p$ solutions to $g(x) \equiv 0 \gmod p$, so adding in $r$ means we know there are \emph{no more than} $n$ pairwise incongruent modulo $p$ solutions to  $f(x) \equiv 0 \gmod p$.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.4}
  Suppose $p$ is a prime and $\ord_p (a) = d$. Then for each natural number $i$ with $(i, d) = 1$, $\ord_p(a^i) = d$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  To find $k = \ord_p (a^i)$, we're looking for the smallest number such that $(a^i)^k \equiv 0 \gmod p$, or in other words $a^{ik} \equiv 0 \gmod p$. By \ref{4.10}, this is only the case when $d | ik$. Since $(i, d) = 1$, we know $d | ik$ implies $d | k$ (easily shown by \ref{2.12}. I swear to God we proved this somewhere, but this is like the 5th time I've gone to cite this imaginary theorem and I never find it). The smallest (natural) $k$ such that $d | k$ is $d$, so $k = \ord_p (a^i) = d$.
\end{proof}



\pagebreak



\begin{thm} \label{6.5}
  For a prime $p$ and a natural number $d$, at most $\phi (d)$ incongruent integers modulo $p$ have order $d$ modulo $p$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Either there is an integer with order $d$, or there isn't. If there isn't we're done, so let's assume there is one and call it $a$.

  We will show that all numbers with order $d$ are congruent to an integer of the form $a^x$ where $(d, x) = 1$ and $x \leq d$. As there are only $\phi(d)$ possible values of $x$, this will mean that all integers with order $d$ will be congruent to one of $\phi(x)$ integers, and thus there can at most be $\phi(x)$ incongruent integers with order $d$.

  Let $k$ be an integer with order $d$. Let $A = \{a, a^2, a^3, \ldots, a^d\}$ and $K = \{a, a^2, a^3, \ldots, a^d\}$. By \ref{4.8}, we know both of these sets are pairwise incongruent. We also know that every element of $A$ is a solution to the equation $x^d - 1 \equiv 0 \gmod p$, as $(a^i)^d - 1 \equiv (a^d)^i - 1 \equiv 1^i - 1 \equiv 0 \gmod p$. Similarly for $K$.
  By \ref{6.3}, there can only be $d$ incongruent solutions to this equation. Thus, since $A$ is full of $d$ pairwise incongruent integers that are all solutions, it must contain one number congruent to each solution. Same with $K$. Thus, for any element of $A$, there must be a congruent element in $K$, and vice versa. Since $k \in K$, we know $k = a^i$ for some $i < d$.

  To see that $(d, i) = 1$, we notice that $k^{d/(d,i)} \equiv a^{d \cdot \frac{i}{(d,i)}} \equiv 1 \gmod p$ (\ref{4.10}) Since the order of $k$ is $d$, we then know $d/(d,i) \geq d$, implying $1 \geq (d,i)$, which means $(d,i) = 1$.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.6}
  Let $p$ be a prime and suppose $g$ is a primitive root modulo $p$. Then the set $\{0, g, g^2, g^3, \ldots, g^{p-1}\}$ forms a CRS modulo $p$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Since this set has $p$ elements, by \ref{3.17}, all we have to do to show this is a CRS is to show that the terms are pairwise incongruent modulo $p$.

  None of the powers will ever be congruent to $0$, because that would imply $p | g^n$ which is impossible since no $p$ can appear in the prime factorization of $g^n$ (as if it did, $g \equiv 0 \gmod p$ and then $g$ has no order).

  Say there are two integers $i, j$ such that $1 \leq i, j \leq p-1$ and $g^i \equiv g^j \gmod p$. Assume WLOG $i > j$. Then $g^i \equiv g^j \gmod p$ implies $g^{i-j} \cdot g^j \equiv 1 \cdot g^j \gmod p$, which by \ref{4.5} means $g^{i-j} \equiv 1 \gmod p$.
  By \ref{5.10}, this means $(p-1) | (i - j)$, but since $0 \leq i - j \leq p-2$ the only multiple of $p-1$ that the difference could be is $0$, implying $i = j$. Thus, if two of the nonzero members of the set are congruent, they are the same element. In other words, they are pairwise incongruent modulo $p$.
\end{proof}

  It says we'll come back to this one.
\end{proof}



\begin{ex} \label{6.9}
  Consider the prime $p = 13$. For each divisor $d = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$ of $12 = p-1$, mark which of the natural numbers in the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 12\}$ have order $d$.
\end{ex}

Order $2$: Just $12$.

Order $3$: $3$, $9$.

Order $4$: $5$, $8$.

Order $6$: $4$, $10$.

Order $12$: $2$, $6$, $7$, $11$.

  Compute each of the following sums
\end{ex}

1. $\sum_{d | 6} \phi(d) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6$

2. $\sum_{d|10} \phi(d) = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10$

3. $\sum_{d|24} \phi(d) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 24$

4. $\sum_{d|36} \phi(d) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 36$

5. $\sum_{d|27} \phi(d) = 1 + 2 + 6 + 18 = 27$

\emph{Make a sweeping conjecture about the sum of $\phi(d)$ taken over all natural divisors of any natural number n.}

\begin{PC} \label{PC 6.18}
  For any natural number $n$,

  $$\sum_{d | n} \phi(d) = n$$
\end{PC}



\begin{thm} \label{6.11}
  If $p$ is a prime, then

  $$\sum_{d|p} \phi(d) = p$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  $\sum_{d|p} \phi(d) = \phi(1) + \phi(p) = 1 + (p-1) = p$.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.12}
  If $p$ is a prime, then

  $$\sum_{d|p^k} \phi(d) = p^k$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  First, notice $\phi(p^i) = p^i - p^{i-1}$ for any natural $i$. This is because there are $p^i$ natural numbers less than or equal to $p^i$, and 1 in every $p$ of them is a multiple of $p$ and thus not relatively prime (i.e. $p^{i} / p = p^{i-1}$ of them are multiple of $p$).

  $\sum_{d|p^k} \phi(d) = \sum_{i=0}^k \phi(p^i) = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^k p^i - p^{i-1} = p^k$.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.13}
  If $p$ and $q$ are two different primes, then

  $$\sum_{d|pq} \phi(d) = pq$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  There are $pq$ natural numbers less than or equal to $pq$. One in $p$ are a multiple of $p$, one in $q$ are a multiple of $q$, and the rest are relatively prime to $pq$. Thus $\phi(pq) = pq - q - p + 1$ (the $+1$ is because we subtracted out $pq$ twice, once as a multiple of $p$ and once as a multiple of $q$.

  $\sum_{d|pq} \phi(d) = \phi(1) + \phi(p) + \phi(q) + \phi(pq) = 1 + (p-1) + (q-1) + (pq - q - p + 1) = pq$
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.14}
  If $n$ and $m$ are relatively prime natural numbers, then

  $$\left( \sum_{d|m} \phi(d) \right) \cdot \left( \sum_{d|n} \phi(d) \right) = \sum_{d|mn} \phi(d)$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  6.23 kills this problem, and I have a proof of it, but I'll come back here and do it once I have that.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.15}
  If $n$ is a natural number, then

  $$\sum_{d|n} \phi(d) = n$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  By FTA, any $n = p_1^{r_1} \cdot p_2^{r_2} \cdot \cdots \cdot p_m^{r_m}$ for distinct primes $p_1$ through $p_m$ and natural numbers $r_1$ through $r_m$. We will induct on $m$.

  Our base case is $m = 0$, which is \ref{6.12}.

  Our inductive hypothesis is that for all $k < m$, if $n = p_1^{r_1} \cdot \cdots \cdot p_k^{r_k}$ then $\sum_{d|n} \phi(d) = n$. Our inductive step must show that this holds for $m$.

  Say $n = p_1^{r_1} \cdot \cdots \cdot p_{m-1}^{r_{m-1}} \cdot p_m^{r_m}$. Let $\eta = p_1^{r_1} \cdot \cdots \cdot p_{m-1}^{r_{m-1}}$. Notice by our inductive hypothesis that $\sum_{d|\eta} \phi(d) = \eta$ and $\sum_{d|p_m^{r_m}} \phi(d) = p_m^{r_m}$.
  Also notice by \ref{2.12} that $(\eta, p_m^{r_m}) = 1$. Then, by \ref{6.14} we see $n = \eta \cdot p_m^{r_m} = \left( \sum_{d|\eta} \phi(d) \right) \cdot \left( \sum_{d|p_m^{r_m}} \phi(d) \right) = \sum_{d|\eta \cdot p_m^{r_m}} \phi(d) = \sum_{d|n} \phi(d)$.

  Removing the middle steps, we find $n = \sum_{d|n} \phi(d)$.
\end{proof}



\begin{ex} \label{6.16}
  For a natrual number $n$ consider the fractions

  $$\frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n}, \frac{3}{n}, \ldots, \frac{n}{n},$$

  all written in reduced form. Try to find a natural one-tone correspondence between the reduced fractions and the number $\phi(d)$ for $d | n$. Show how that ovservation provides a very clever proof to the preceding theorem.
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}
  For any $d | n$, there are $\phi(d)$ fractions that have $d$ as their denominator in simplest form.

  Notice that for any $d | n$, the list of fractions above will contain all of $\frac{1}{d}, \frac{2}{d}, \ldots, \frac{d}{d}$. This is because for any $u \leq d$, we know $\frac{u}{d} \cdot (n/d) = \frac{u(n/d)}{n}$, and $u(n/d) = n(u/d) \leq n$ because $u/d \leq 1$.

  Thus, there are $d$ ``candidates'' for fractions with $d$ as their denominator in simplest form. Notice that since simplest form is when the numerator and denominator are relatively prime, these fractions do have $d$ as their denominator in simplest form exactly when the numerator is relatively prime to $d$. Since the numerator can be any value from $1$ to $d$, this means the number of fractions with $d$ as the denominator in simplest form is equal to the number of natruals form $1$ to $d$ that are relatively prime to $d$, or $\phi(d)$.

  Notice, then, that every fraction in the series $\frac{1}{n}, \ldots, \frac{n}{n}$ has to have a simplest form (with some divisor of $n$ as the denominator). Thus, if we add up the number of fractions with $d$ as their denominator in simplest form for all $d | n$, we'll get the number of fractions (which is $n$, since there are $n$ possibilities for the numerator). In other words, since $\phi(d)$ is the number of fractions with $d$ in their denominator in simplest form, we're saying $n = \sum_{d | n} \phi(d)$.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.17}
  Every prime $p$ has $\phi(p-1)$ primitive roots.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  It's the last week of high school, this is going to be pretty informal.

  There are $p-1$ numbers less than $p$ that all have to have some order. Since we know for any $k$ that $k^{p-1} \equiv 1 \gmod p$ by \ref{4.15} (Fermat's Little), we know by \ref{4.10} that the order of every number needs to divide $p-1$. Thus, the possible orders are the divisors of $p-1$. For each divisor $d$, there are $\phi(d)$ ``slots'' (as only $\phi(d)$ incongruent numbers can have order $d$ by \ref{6.5}).
  Thus, the total number of ``slots'' is $\sum_{d|p-1} \phi(d)$, which by \ref{6.15} means there are $p-1$ slots. Since there are $p-1$ numbers, this means every slot must be filled: there are $\phi(p-1)$ ``slots'' for numbers with order $p-1$, and so since all are filled there must be $\phi(p-1)$ numbers with order $p-1$, i.e. $\phi(p-1)$ primitive roots of $p$.
\end{proof}

  Make a conjecture about the value $\phi(p)$ for a prime $p$. Prove your conjecture.
\end{ex}

\begin{PC} \label{PC 6.18}
  For any prime $p$, $\phi(p) = p-1$
\end{PC}

\begin{proof}
  There are $p-1$ numbers less than $p$ and all of them are relatively prime to $p$ since $p$ is prime.
\end{proof}



\begin{ex} \label{6.19}
  Make a conjecture about the value $\phi(p^k)$ for a priem $p$ and natural numbers $k$. Prove your conjecture.
\end{ex}

\begin{PC} \label{PC 6.19}
  If $p$ is a prime and $k$ is a natural number, then $\phi(p^k) = p^k - p^{k-1}$.
\end{PC}

\begin{proof}
  There are $p^k$ natural numbers less than or equal to $p^k$. Of those, $1$ in every $p$ have a $p$ in their prime factorization and thus are not relatively prime to $p^k$, so we need to subtract the $p^k / p = p^{k-1}$ non-relatively-prime numbers from that set, leaving us with $p^k - p^{k-1}$ remaining numbers.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{5.20}
  If $n$ is a natural number and $A$ is a CRS modulo $n$, then the number of numbers in $A$ that are relatively prime to $n$ is equal to $\phi(n)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Let $a \in A$ and $k$ be the unique member of the CCRS modulo $n$ such that $a \equiv k \gmod n$. We find $(a, n) | n$ and thus $(a, n) | (a - k)$, and thus $(a, n) | k$. Similarly, we find $(k, n) | a$. Thus, $(a, n) = (k, n)$, implying that $a$ is relatively prime if and only if $k$ is.

  Since we can cast each member of $A$ uniquely to the CCRS this way, we find counting the number of numbers in $A$ that are relatively prime to $n$ is the same as counting the number of numbers in the CCRS that are relatively prime to $n$. Since the CCRS is just $\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$, it's clear that the latter is $\phi(n)$, and thus so is the number of numbers in $A$ that are relativley prime to $n$.
\end{proof}



\begin{thm} \label{6.21}
  If $n$ is a natural number, $k$ is an integer, and $m$ is an integer relatively prime to $n$, then the set of $n$ integers

  $$\{k, k+m, k+2m, k+3m, \ldots, k + (n-1)m\}$$

  is a complete residue system modulo $n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  By \ref{3.17}, we merely need to show the consituents of this set are incongruent modulo $n$, since there are clearly $n$ elements.

  Say $k + im \equiv k + jm \gmod n$. This implies $n | (k+im - (k+jm))$, implying $n | (im - jm)$ or $n | m(i-j)$. Since $(n, m) = 1$, we cite \ref{1.41} to conclude $n | i-j$. Since $0 \leq i, j \leq n-1$, we know $-n+1 \leq i-j \leq n-1$, and the only number in that range divided by $n$ is $0$, so $i = j$.

  Thus, two seperate elements (i.e. two elements such that $i \neq j$) cannot be congruent modulo $n$, showing the set is a CRS.

\begin{ex} \label{6.22}
  Consider the relatively prime natural numbers $9$ and $4$. Write down all the natural numbers less than or equal to $36 = 9 \cdot 4$ in a rectangular array that is $9$ wide and $4$ high. Then circle those numbers in that array that are relatively prime to $36$. Try some other examples using relatively prime natural numbers.
\end{ex}

I'm... gonna be honest, I did this and it was not enlightening. I have no idea what's going on.

OH WAIT the columns all have the same number of circles! Cool!



\begin{thm} \label{6.23}
  If $n$ and $m$ are relatively prime natural numbers, then

  $$\phi(mn) = \phi(m)\phi(n)$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Take any number $a \leq mn$. By division algorithm, $a = k + qm$ for some $0 \leq k < m$. We're going to make a slight tweak: If $a = 0 + qm$, instead write it as $a = m + (q-1)m$, so that $0 < k \leq m$.

  By \ref{1.43}, if $(a, m) = 1$ and $(a, n) = 1$ then $(a, mn) = 1$. The opposite is also true since $(a, m) | (a, mn)$, so if $(a, mn) = 1$ then $(a, m) = 1$ (and $(a, n) = 1$).

  Thus, the only way for $a = k + qm$ to be relatively prime to $mn$ is if $(a, m) = 1$ and $(a, n) = 1$.

  We notice $(a, m) = 1$ if and only if $(k, m) = 1$ (as $(a, m) | k + qm$ implies $(a, m) | k$ so $(a, m) | (k, m)$ and $(k, m) | k$ implies $(k, m) | k + qm$ and thus $(k, m) | a$ so $(k, m) | (a, m)$).

  There are thus $\phi(m)$ possibilities for $k$. For each of these, we examine the set $\{k, k + m, \ldots, k + (n-1)m$. By \ref{6.21}, this is a CRS modulo $n$, and by \ref{6.20} that means there are exactly $\phi(n)$ elements of this set that are relatively prime to $n$.

  Thus, there are $\phi(m)$ sets that each have $\phi(n)$ numbers that are relatively prime to both $m$ and $n$ (and thus relatively prime to $mn$). Thus, the total number of numbers less than $mn$ that are relatively prime to $mn$ is $\phi(mn) = \phi(m) \cdot \phi(n)$.
\end{proof}



\begin{ex} \label{6.24}
  Compute each of the following.
\end{ex}

1. $\phi(3) = 2$

2. $\phi(5) = 4$

3. $\phi(15) = \phi(3) \cdot \phi(5) = 8$

4. $\phi(45) = \phi(9) \cdot \phi(5) = 24$

5. $\phi(98) = \phi(2) \cdot \phi(7^2) = 42$

6. $\phi(5^6 11^4 17^{10}) = \phi(5^6) \cdot \phi(11^4) \cdot \phi(17^{10}) = 5^5 11^3 17^9 \cdot 4 \cdot 10 \cdot 16 = 2^7 5^6 11^3 17^9$



\begin{ques} \label{6.25}
  To what power would you raise 15 to be certain that you would get an answer that is congruent to $1$ modulo $98$? Why?
\end{ques}

By \ref{4.32} (Euler's theorem), 42.



\begin{ques} \label{6.26}
  How many primitive roots does the prime $251$ have?
\end{ques}

By \ref{6.17}, it has $\phi(250) = \phi(2) \cdot \phi(5^3) = 1 \cdot 5^3 - 5^2 = 100$ primitive roots.
